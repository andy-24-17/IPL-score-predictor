# ILP Score Predictor

This project implements machine learning models to predict cricket match scores. The dataset is processed and used to train multiple models, and their performance is compared to determine the most accurate predictions.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling categorical variables using one-hot encoding and preparing datasets for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Implements and evaluates various regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models using:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error
- **Visualization**: Optional graphical representation of predictions versus actual data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
